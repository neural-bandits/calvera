do we specify that loss must be between 0 and 1? -> try to avoid it
Should we do loss or reward? -> Giovanni prefers rewards. Possibly ask for max_reward if needed.

How to do Hyperparameter Tuning? -> discuss January

Properties of Eigenvalues: Figure out why minimal eigenvalue of the covariance matrix comes up in the ComBand regret bound?

Try to make smaller PRs. Especially for algorithms where one other person should check if they are implemented correctly.
