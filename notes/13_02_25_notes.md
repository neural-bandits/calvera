Model bad Name for NeuralUCB / LightningModule

Consistency of the Interface is important (consider having the same parameters for all Modules)

Missing:
- warm_start (per MLP training)
- We need to worry about saving / storing the Modules and Models (nn)
- HoldOut set, evaluation using progressive validation (use next batch)
- Special selectors folder (maybe inside the bandits folder?
- Move Contextualizer into benchmark directory
- How is __init__ documentation visualised?
- Provide Links to inside the documentation
- Documentation -> Sphinx for documentation?
- Short example inside the docstring
- Fix the benchmark


Convert AllDataStrategy into Dataloader then perform training

Keep granularity at data points not (batches)

Also run small experiments e.g. head_update (not required -> easy nice things to add)

Do the simplest thing possible and let NN figure it out (Combinatorial Bandits)
