# Contribution Rules

## Plan of working together
- assign different tasks (issues in the Github repo.)
- try to work separately on your issues (the ones in the Github repo :) )
- as we dont have weeklies, just write in the group
- for weekly updates with Giovanni add the things you want to discuss to meeting notes.


## How to work on an issue
1. Assign yourself to the issue.
2. Create a new branch with the issue number and a short description. (like `1-fix-typo`)
3. Make your changes (including reasonable unit tests).
4. Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
5. Ensure that ALL tests pass and format / lint / typing is correct. (`make all` / `make test` / `make lint` / `make format` / `make mypy`)
6. Document all of the user facing library code. 
7. Ask someone for a review if you need it.

## Documentation
- Follow the google styleguide section: [3.8 Comments and Docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Consider using pdoc3 to generate documentation for the library automatically.


## Timeplan
- have MVP ready by 1st of February 2025
- final deadline on 25th of March 2025
